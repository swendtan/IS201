                        <p>When my parents first told me where we were moving, I had never even heard of the country before. I distinctly remember my 8-year-old self spinning a globe trying to search for this foreign place I would soon call home.</p>
                        <p>What I could not have possibly envisioned then, was the transformative experience it would become for me and my family. The international school with friends from over 80 different countries became the bedrock for my understanding of the world around me.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Looking Forward</h2>
                        <p>Making plans for the future, I knew I would miss the remarkable childhood and the second-family I had gained. However, I also was excited to jump into the amazing familial culture and environment that Brigham Young University also had to offer.</p>
                        <p>With a weighted GPA of 4.3, ACT score of 33, and SAT score of 1520, I had put in the work on paper to apply to the highly esteemed university. Arguably the most important criteria, however, was also what confirmed to me that BYU was the right place for me.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">A Home Away from Home</h2>
                        <p>The emphasis on lifelong learning and serving our fellow man through a focus on Christlike leadership are the key tenets of Brigham Young University. They are felt immediately when you enter a classroom, listen to a devotional, or speak to staff or faculty. These points of emphasis make you feel right at home.</p>

                        <p>Beautiful mountains, four distinct seasons, and wonderful people make the environment here even richer. It has been a joy to pursue my higher education within the business school with an upcoming emphasis on Strategic Management right here in Provo, Utah, my new home away from home.</p>
